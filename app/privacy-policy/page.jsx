						6. GDPR
					</SubHeading>
					<Paragraph>
						"Our industry participants count on DIDx to be worthy of trust in the cloud. We take GDPR as the chance to prove we are worthy of that trust and to set the bar for data privacy and protection as very serious and a must-have." CEO, Rehan Allahwala
					</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>
						DIDx complies with all data privacy laws and directives, including the PwC of USA and the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”).
					</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>
						DIDx enables its clients and vendors to interface their products in our and each others' software applications. We do not have a direct relationship with any of their end users. When clients share end user data, we approach the data with a goal to comply with data protection regulations, including the GDPR and PwC. We refuse to and do not use any of that data for purposes except those that are expressly required by the customer who gives us the data. The other reason to use the data is onnly as is required under law.
					</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>
						Our compliance with the GDPR and PwC policies, we want to refer to the terms “controller” and “processor." A “controller” is the business that an individual (“data subject”) shares personal data with. The "controller" decides the reason for the use of the personal data and is accountable for the law-abiding use of the data subject’s data. A “processor” is the business that makes available any of part services to the controller and requires particular personal data under the control of the controller.
					</Paragraph>
					<Paragraph>
						DIDx works with vendors and buyers. It is a medium for enabling the purchase and sales of DID numbers among vendors and buyers. During different aspects of business, DIDx may be a controller and at other times a processor. When DIDx processes the communications media and data provided by a client, such as between DIDx and the customer, typically DIDx is the processor. When DIDx processes communications metadata, DIDx is a processor. It may be deemed necessary to work as a controller in others. When DIDx processes a client or vendor's company or personal data that either has provided through our online marketplace or other, DIDx acts the part of a controller. As DIDx acts as controller or processor, it does everything possible to make sure that the entities we collaborate with will adhere to GDPR and PwC. We do everything in our power to make sure that any other party will not manipulate, manage or use the data in any way that that our client or vendor has relied upon us for any reason than providing services purchased.
					</Paragraph>
					<SubHeading>
						Object to and restrict the processing of data
					</SubHeading>
					<Paragraph>
						In any case that a client or vendor's company or personal data appears to be processed to fulfill a common interest to DIDx, like PR or marketing, the company or individual has every right to object to and unsubscribe to DIDx. We welcome these objections and requests to unsubscribe to made to legal@didx.net. Per GDPR and PwC, each client and vendor has every right to restrict processing. DIDx will ensure to process client or vendor data each requests. DIDx will take each request seriously and as a one-on-one basis out of business respect and according to the rules set out by the GDPR and PwC. In any case where DIDx cannot comply with the request, we will demonstrate our legal and compelling grounds to do that. In some cases, there are legal claims that enable DIDx to retain personal data. In any case in which the client or vendor does not agree with the manner that we handle any request, the client or vendor has a right to file a complaint with the government authorities related to the member state or country that the client or vendor resides or works in, as well in any state or country where suspected infringement occurs
